        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I was born and brought up in Bangalore, India where I completed my
          undergrad in Computer Science. As a graduate student at San Diego
          State University, I have completed all of the requirements for my
          major and am fully proficient in Software Developement and Data
          Science. My most noteworthy personal project involved building a
          recommendation engine using content-based strategies defined by users
          across 16000+ different anime’s which I created using Python,
          Information Retrieval Techniques and Machine Learning techniques. My
          skills focus mostly on Problem Solving(Data Structures and
          Algorithms), Java, Python, C and Data Science. In my spare time I
          taught myself Low Level Design and System Design because I knew it
          would prepare me for a variety of software development roles.

          <h3>Cricket</h3>
          <p>
            I play competitive cricket for San Diego Warriors team, tournament
            hosted by San Diego Cricket Assosciation. Passing by a street,
            whenever you hear “Indiaaa…indiiaaa”, the question arises “was it
            today? Was India’s ‘cricket match’ against a xyz country today? How
            did I forget! How did I miss it?” Yes, that’s what happens with all
            of us! (Or most of us) We are Indians, after all! The very basic
            characteristic that you can associate with being an Indian is love
            for cricket.

          <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
          <p>
            Researched on “Classification of chronic obstructive pulmonary
            disease” using Deep Neural Network. Implemented a Fully
            Convolutional Network (FCN) on the flow sequence generated from the
            expiratory Flow-Volume Curve (FVC) to classify structural lung
            diseases as the outcome which outperformed traditional measures of
            spirometry.
